# Project Overview

This project focuses on the basics of ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), a version of JavaScript that introduces several new features and syntax improvements. The tasks cover various ES6 concepts, including block-scoped variables, arrow functions, default parameters, rest and spread operators, template literals, and more. The objective is to provide a hands-on approach to learning these concepts by applying them in real-world scenarios.

## Files Overview

- **0-constants.js**: Modifies functions to use `const` and `let` for variable declarations.
- **1-block-scoped.js**: Ensures variables are not overwritten inside conditional blocks using block-scoped variables.
- **2-arrow.js**: Rewrites a standard function to use ES6 arrow function syntax.
- **3-default-parameter.js**: Simplifies a function by setting default values for its parameters.
- **4-rest-parameter.js**: Modifies a function to use the rest parameter syntax to return the number of arguments passed.
- **5-spread-operator.js**: Concatenates arrays and string characters using the spread operator in a single line.
- **6-string-interpolation.js**: Refactors a function to use template literals for string interpolation.
- **7-getBudgetObject.js**: Simplifies object property assignment using ES6 shorthand syntax.
- **8-getBudgetCurrentYear.js**: Uses computed property names to dynamically create object properties.
- **9-getFullBudget.js**: Utilizes ES6 method properties in an object.
- **10-loops.js**: Rewrites a function using ES6 `for...of` loops.
- **11-createEmployeesObject.js**: Creates an object representing a department and its employees.
- **12-createReportObject.js**: Generates a report object with a method to get the number of departments.
- **100-createIteratorObject.js**: Returns an iterator for iterating through employees in different departments.
- **101-iterateThroughObject.js**: Returns a string of employee names separated by `|`, iterating through an object.
